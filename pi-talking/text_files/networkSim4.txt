Ohhhh spooky

Pigeon Story:

The pigeon wore a tiny top hat as it strutted confidently across the cobblestone plaza, completely unfazed by the bewildered stares of passersby. Somewhere nearby, a street musician played a jaunty tune on an accordion, which the pigeon seemed to march in perfect rhythm to. A child pointed and laughed, swearing she saw the bird wink before it took off, top hat still firmly in place, gliding toward the horizon like some mysterious feathery gentleman on a secret mission.

Moments later, the pigeon landed atop a nearby rooftop café, where a group of seagulls sat playing cards and sipping espresso from thimble-sized cups. “You’re late,” one squawked, tossing down a royal flush. The pigeon cooed coolly, adjusting his hat. “Traffic,” he replied. A hush fell over the table as he pulled a tiny envelope from under his wing and slid it across. Inside was a feather—bright blue and shimmering slightly. The gulls exchanged nervous glances. This wasn’t just a game anymore. This was war.

The moment the shimmering blue feather touched the table, the café lights flickered. One of the younger gulls—barely out of fledglinghood—gulped. “Is that... the mark?” he whispered. The top-hatted pigeon gave a single nod, then casually pecked at a crumb on the table like nothing had happened. The table erupted into squawks. The Blue Feather was an ancient symbol, a signal that The Roost—a long-forgotten coalition of sky-dwellers sworn to protect the skies—was being reactivated.

Back on the plaza, the child who had seen the pigeon wink tugged on her dad’s sleeve. “The bird... it’s part of something big. I know it,” she insisted. Her dad chuckled, brushing her off—just as a feather, blue and glowing faintly, drifted down from the sky and landed on her shoulder.

On the rooftops, a cloaked owl touched down in complete silence. “We don’t have much time,” he hooted. “The Falcons have moved. The Worm Protocol has begun.” The pigeon sighed and removed his hat, revealing a tiny pair of night-vision goggles underneath. “Then let’s fly.”
