Pigeon Story:

The pigeon wore a tiny top hat as it strutted confidently across the cobblestone plaza, completely unfazed by the bewildered stares of passersby. Somewhere nearby, a street musician played a jaunty tune on an accordion, which the pigeon seemed to march in perfect rhythm to. A child pointed and laughed, swearing she saw the bird wink before it took off, top hat still firmly in place, gliding toward the horizon like some mysterious feathery gentleman on a secret mission.
